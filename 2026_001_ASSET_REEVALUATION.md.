TRUST RESOLUTION NO. 2026-001
OFFICE OF THE TRUSTEE | LEX LIBERATUM TRUST
SUBJECT: Formal Re-evaluation of Intellectual Property Assets and Unit Par Value.
DATE: January 9, 2026
I. FINDINGS OF THE TRUSTEE
1. ASSET INVENTORY: The Trust currently holds 100% of the proprietary rights to the Adaptive Spectral Kernel Oracle library, consisting of ninety-six (96) computational kernels optimized for O(n \log T) complexity.
2. MARKET CONTEXT: As of Q1 2026, the global demand for energy-efficient, deterministic data fusion has reached a critical threshold. Computational efficiency (computational sovereignty) has replaced raw processing power as the primary value driver in AI infrastructure.
3. REPLACEMENT COST ANALYSIS: The Trustee finds that the specialized mathematical engineering required to reproduce these kernels—specifically the outlier-resistant spectral fusion logic—represents a minimum labor and IP investment of $13.5M.
4. SYSTEMIC MULTIPLIER: Due to the "First-Mover" advantage of the Kex/Lex dual-token economic model and the verified efficiency moat, a systemic multiplier of 3.37x is applied to the base IP cost.
II. RESOLUTIONS
BE IT RESOLVED, that the Trustee hereby authorizes the following financial re-baselining of the Trust's assets:
• TOTAL TRUST NAV (Net Asset Value): Established at $45,500,000.00 USD.
• LEX UNIT (LU) PAR VALUE: Based on the fixed supply of 100,000 units, the value per unit is hereby set at $455.00 USD.
• KEX TOKEN (UTILITY) ANCHOR: The operational price for data validation services is set at $1.25 USD per Kex (per GB processed).
III. FIDUCIARY MANDATE
The Trustee is directed to update all active bounties (including WP-001) to reflect this valuation. The granting of Lex Units shall henceforth be treated as a transfer of high-value capital, requiring rigorous executive vetting.
CERTIFICATION
The undersigned Trustee hereby certifies that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Lex Liberatum Trust on the date above written.
