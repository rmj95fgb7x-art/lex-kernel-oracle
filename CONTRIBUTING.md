# ⚖️ Lex Liberatum Trust: Sovereign Contributor Agreement

Welcome to the Lex Kernel Oracle. By contributing to this repository, you are not just writing code; you are participating in the construction of a **Universal Truth Layer** and earning a stake in its future.

## 1. The Sweat Equity Model (Lex Units)
We operate on a **Proof-of-Contribution** basis. Contributors do not just "patch bugs"; they earn **Lex Units (LU)**.
* **Lex Units** represent a fractional interest in the licensing revenue generated by the specific kernel suites you optimize.
* **Tiers:** * **Architect:** (Systems logic/Orchestration) - High LU Multiplier.
    * **Specialist:** (Industry-specific kernels, e.g., Moran-Shield) - Vertical-specific LU.
    * **Validator:** (Clinical or Field testing) - Stability-based LU.

## 2. High-Priority Bounties: "The Moran-Shield"
Our immediate focus is the **$3.5M/Clinic Savings Pilot** for pediatric ophthalmology. 
**Architects needed for:**
* **DICOM/HL7 Ingestion:** Standardizing the 11 Pediatric Kernels for clinical EHR integration.
* **Edge Orchestration:** Optimizing the Docker environment for zero-latency, on-prem medical servers.

## 3. How to Participate
1. **Claim a Stake:** View open issues tagged with `[SWEAT-EQUITY-BOUNTY]`.
2. **Submit Proof:** Open a Pull Request. Your code must maintain the $O(n \log T)$ efficiency standard.
3. **Vesting:** Once your PR is merged and validated in a live pilot (e.g., Moran Eye Center), your Lex Units are recorded in the Trust Ledger.

## 4. Intellectual Property
All contributions are licensed under the Lex Liberatum Sovereign License. You retain credit as an "Original Architect," and the Trust ensures your pro-rata share of the vertical's value capture.
