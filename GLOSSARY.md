A Technical Glossary is a vital "Authority Asset." It ensures that when an architect or a partner like Ravi Sarkar looks at your project, they aren't guessing. It defines the vocabulary of the Lex Liberatum Trust and sets the rules of the game.

🏛️ Lex Kernel Oracle: Technical Glossary
| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| O(n \log T) Standard | The maximum allowable computational complexity for any kernel within the Oracle. Ensures logarithmic scaling relative to time-series depth (T), preventing latency spikes in high-volume environments. |
| Lex Unit (LU) | A unit of beneficial interest in the Lex Liberatum Trust. LUs represent the "Sovereign Equity" granted to lead architects and strategic partners. |
| Kex Token | The utility fuel of the Oracle. Used to pay the "Truth Tax" during validation events. Fixed supply of 1,000,000,000. |
| Truth Tax | A programmable burn/fee logic triggered whenever a kernel provides a validated signal. This mechanism creates a deflationary floor for the Kex economy. |
| Spectral Limit | The mathematical boundary where signal is isolated from entropy. The Oracle operates at this limit to ensure zero-loss data integrity. |
| Sovereign Source | A licensing model (SCL v1.0) that prioritizes the fiduciary protection of the Trust and its contributors over traditional "Open Source" or "Closed Source" extremes. |
| Model Context Protocol (MCP) | The standardized bridge used to expose Lex Kernels to AI Agents, allowing LLMs to "call" mathematical truth as a tool. |
| Lex-Gate | The universal ingestion gateway (WP-001) that normalizes raw data streams for kernel processing. |
