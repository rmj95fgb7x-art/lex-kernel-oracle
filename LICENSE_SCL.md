🏛️ Sovereign Contributor License (SCL) v1.0
Lex Liberatum Trust | Adaptive Spectral Kernel Oracle
1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
By submitting a Pull Request (PR), committing code, or accepting a Lex Unit (LU) grant for this repository, the Contributor ("Architect") agrees to be bound by the fiduciary standards and economic resolutions of the Lex Liberatum Trust.
2. FIDUCIARY ALIGNMENT
The Architect acknowledges that the Lex Units granted (e.g., Bounty WP-001) are valued based on Trust Resolution 2026-001 ($455.00/unit). The Architect agrees to perform all duties with a fiduciary duty to maintain the mathematical integrity (O(n \log T)) and the economic value of these units.
3. THE ROYALTY MANDATE
The Architect agrees that all code developed for the Universal Lex-Gate or subsequent gateways must strictly enforce Trust Resolution 2026-002.
• Metering: Every gigabyte of data processed must trigger a 1.0 Kex royalty.
• Non-Bypass: The Architect shall not implement any "backdoor" or "bypass" that allows kernel execution without the associated "Truth Tax" capture.
4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REVERSION
All contributions made under this license are the sole property of the Lex Liberatum Trust. In exchange for Lex Units, the Architect grants the Trust an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable license to all code submitted. If the Architect is found in breach of fiduciary duty (e.g., intentional efficiency degradation or royalty bypass), the Trust reserves the right to claw back unvested Lex Units.
5. VALUATION ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The Architect stipulates that they have reviewed the Trust Asset Registry and Resolution 2026-001. They accept the $45.5M Trust valuation as the basis for their equity stake and waive the right to challenge this valuation during the vesting period.
CONTRIBUTOR SIGN-OFF (Digital)
Agreement is triggered by the submission of the Architect's Design Document and SHA-256 Hash Handshake.
