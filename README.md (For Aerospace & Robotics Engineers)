Lex Liberatum: Universal C-Kernel SDK
Fiduciary Intelligence for Mission-Critical Embedded Systems
This SDK provides a portable, deterministic C99 implementation of the Adaptive Spectral Fusion (Theorem 2) algorithm. Designed for deployment in high-stakes environments—including Aerospace (F-35 telemetry), Industrial Robotics, and Autonomous Infrastructure—where sensor integrity is non-negotiable.
🚀 Key Advantages
• Byzantine Fault Tolerance: Mathematically rejects up to 49% adversarial or "poisoned" sensor data.
• MISRA-C Compliant: No dynamic memory allocation (malloc), making it suitable for safety-critical (ISO 26262 / DO-178C) systems.
• Deterministic Performance: Fixed execution time per fusion cycle, preventing "jitter" in flight control or real-time robotics.
• On-Chain Auditability: Designed to pair with the Lex Liberatum Trust on Base Sepolia for permanent execution logging.
🛠 Integration
1. Drop-in Files: Add lex_kernel.h and lex_kernel.c to your build system.
2. Initialize: Define your LexKernelConfig with a \tau (Tau) value suited for your environment's noise floor.
3. Execute: Call lex_execute_fusion() inside your primary control loop.
LexKernelConfig f35_config = { .tau = 0.85f, .last_fused_truth = 0.0f };
float raw_sensors[5] = {10.1, 10.2, 9.9, 25.0, 10.0}; // 25.0 is an outlier/spoof
float truth = lex_execute_fusion(raw_sensors, 5, &f35_config);
// Result: 10.05 (Spoofed 25.0 is mathematically discarded)
