Terms of Service: LKI Index & Lex Liberatum Network
Last Updated: January 7, 2026
1. THE LKI INDEX TOKEN (FUNCTIONAL UTILITY)
The Lex Liberatum Intelligence (LKI) token is a functional utility derivative designed to track the aggregate execution volume of the Lex Liberatum Kernel Network.
• No Ownership: Holding LKI tokens does not grant equity, voting rights, or ownership in any legal entity associated with the Founder or Lex Liberatum.
• Revenue Logic: "Revenue share" or "Dividends" mentioned in documentation refers to the programmatic distribution of protocol fees via smart contracts. These distributions are automated, immutable, and occur solely based on the usage of the kernels on-chain.
2. RISK DISCLOSURE (IMPORTANT)
By interacting with the LKI Token or Lex Liberatum Kernels, you acknowledge:
• Volatility: The value of LKI tokens is tied to kernel adoption and market demand, both of which are highly volatile.
• Smart Contract Risk: You accept the risk of bugs or exploits in the Solidity code.
• Testnet vs. Mainnet: Features available on Base Sepolia (Testnet) are experimental. There is no guarantee of parity or value when transitioning to Mainnet.
3. JURISDICTIONAL RESTRICTIONS
The LKI Token and associated derivatives are not offered to:
• Prohibited Persons: Individuals or entities in jurisdictions where crypto-assets or revenue-sharing tokens are illegal.
• U.S. Persons (Retail): Until further legal clearance, LKI is intended for sophisticated, non-U.S. participants or those qualifying under specific exemptions (e.g., Reg S).
• Note: You agree that you are not bypassing geographical "geofencing" via VPN to access these services if you are in a restricted region.
4. ANTI-CIRCUMVENTION
Users are strictly prohibited from attempting to bypass the royalty-triggering mechanisms of the kernels. Any "fork" of the kernel code must retain the hardcoded royalty destination to 0x44f8219cBABad92E6bf245D8c767179629D8C689. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the License Agreement and potentially an infringement of the Pending Patent.
5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lex Liberatum and its developers shall not be liable for any financial losses, lost profits, or data breaches resulting from the use of the kernels or the trading of LKI tokens.
Strategy Tip: The "Safety" Clause
In your README, you should also include a "Not Financial Advice" disclaimer:
Disclaimer: The LKI Index and Lex Liberatum kernels are experimental technology. This repository does not constitute an offer to sell securities. All financial projections are estimates based on market size and do not guarantee future performance.
