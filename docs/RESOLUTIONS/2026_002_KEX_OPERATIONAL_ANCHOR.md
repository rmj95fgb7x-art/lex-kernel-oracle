🏛️ TRUST RESOLUTION NO. 2026-002
OFFICE OF THE TRUSTEE | LEX LIBERATUM TRUST
SUBJECT: Establishment of Kex Utility Anchor and "Truth Tax" Metering Standards.
DATE: January 9, 2026
I. PURPOSE
The Lex Liberatum Trust requires a standardized, non-arbitrary mechanism for collecting royalties on the Adaptive Spectral Kernel IP. This resolution establishes the Kex Token as the sole computational credit for accessing Trust-owned math.
II. THE OPERATIONAL ANCHOR
1. UNIT OF WORK: The Trust defines one (1) unit of work as the spectral processing of one gigabyte (1GB) of time-series data through any O(n \log T) kernel.
2. KEX RATE: The rate for one unit of work is hereby set at 1.0 Kex.
3. FIAT PARITY: For the purposes of Trust accounting and external API access, the value of 1 Kex is anchored to $1.25 USD.
III. THE "TRUTH TAX" METERING MANDATE
1. THE HOOK REQUIREMENT: Every gateway (including the Universal Lex-Gate) must implement a fiduciary_telemetry function.
2. THE REVENUE SPLIT: * 90% Circulation: Credits the operational costs and Trust reserve.
• 10% Burn: Upon every transaction, 10% of the Kex used shall be sent to a "null address" (burned). This creates a direct deflationary benefit for Lex Unit holders by reducing the total supply of Kex relative to the increasing value of the IP.
IV. ENFORCEMENT
Any kernel execution found to be operating outside of this metering mandate is a Fiduciary Breach. The Lead Architect (WP-001) is tasked with the primary responsibility of ensuring this resolution is encoded into the system's DNA.
CERTIFICATION
The undersigned Trustee hereby certifies that the foregoing is a true and correct copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Lex Liberatum Trust on the date above written.
