TRUST RESOLUTION NO. 2026-002
RE: OPERATIONAL ANCHORING OF THE KEX UTILITY TOKEN
WHEREAS, the Lex Liberatum Trust (the "Trust") utilizes the Kex Token as the primary unit of account for the "Truth Tax" (computational royalties) across its ninety (90) O(n \log T) kernels; and
WHEREAS, the global 2026 compute market has established a premium for energy-efficient, hallucination-free AI processing; and
WHEREAS, the Trustee seeks to ensure that Kex maintains a stable, predictable cost-of-use for the Trust’s industrial partners;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:
1. UTILITY ANCHOR: The value of 1 Kex is hereby anchored to the processing of 1 Gigabyte (1GB) of spectral data via a Trust-validated O(n \log T) kernel.
2. PAR PRICE POINT: The initial exchange rate for internal Trust operations is established at $1.25 USD per Kex.
3. DEFLATIONARY MANDATE: 10% of all Kex tokens collected via "Truth Tax" telemetry shall be permanently burned (removed from circulation), creating a direct value-link between network volume and Lex Unit scarcity.
4. METERING COMPLIANCE: All newly developed gateways (including WP-001) must implement the Kex_Meter hook to ensure 100% royalty capture at the resolution’s rate.
